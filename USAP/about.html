        <h4>Kristen Duron</h4>
        <p class="self-description">I'm Kristen Duron, the heart behind this project. My inspiration came from a deeply personal experience when I discovered that some of my own family members were resorting to illegal means due to corruption in pursuit of success.
          In the midst of this, I also witnessed the dreams of many individuals who longed to come to the U.S. legally but didn't know how. Surrounded by stories of resilience and legal success, exemplified by my parents and my project partner, I was inspired to create this website. I aim to instill in the minds of those dreaming of coming to the USA that it is indeed possible.

          I created a website with my Computer Science background in hopes to serve the people with simplified information, mantaining in mind my prupose of helping out.

        <h1>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
          in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h1>
        <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
          the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        <h1> Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h1>
        <p> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
          professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
          did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
          could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
          100% recommend! ”</p>

          <p> “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program
            gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable
